Other benefits of doing cardio every day include improved mood, increased energy levels, and better sleep.</p><h3>Cons</h3><p>While doing cardio every day has many benefits, it can also have some negative effects on your body. Overdoing cardio can lead to injuries, such as stress fractures, shin splints, and muscle strains. Additionally, doing too much cardio can lead to burnout, where you lose motivation and interest in working out.
