However, in general, it is recommended to work out for at least 30-45 minutes, 3-4 times a week, if you want to gain muscle.</p><p>It is also important to note that the intensity of your workouts is more important than the duration. You should focus on doing compound exercises that target multiple muscle groups, such as squats, deadlifts, and bench press. You should also lift weights that are heavy enough to challenge your muscles and cause them to grow.</p><p>Additionally, it is important to give your muscles enough time to recover between workouts.
