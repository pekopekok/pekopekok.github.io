They primarily work the glutes, hamstrings, and lower back, but also engage the quads, calves, and core. To do a deadlift, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, and grip a barbell with your hands slightly wider than your legs. Keep your back straight and your chest up as you lift the bar off the ground, then lower it back down with control.</p><p>Deadlifts are a compound exercise, which means they work multiple muscle groups at once. They're also a great way to improve your grip strength and overall body stability. However, they can be tough on your lower back, so it's important to start with a light weight and gradually increase as you get stronger.</p><h3 id="squats">Squats</h3><p>Squats are another essential exercise for building lower-body strength and muscle. They primarily work the quads, hamstrings, and glutes, but also engage the core and lower back. To do a squat, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, and lower your hips down as if you're sitting in a chair. Keep your back straight and your chest up as you lower, then push back up through your heels.</p><p>Squats are also a compound exercise, and can be done with a barbell, dumbbells, or just your body weight. They're great for building leg and glute strength, improving your balance and coordination, and increasing your overall power and explosiveness. However, they can be tough on your knees if done incorrectly, so it's important to use proper form and start with a light weight.</p><h3 id="bench-press">Bench Press</h3><p>The bench press is perhaps the most well-known exercise for building upper-body strength and muscle. It primarily works the chest, shoulders, and triceps, but also engages the biceps and upper back. To do a bench press, lie on a bench with your feet flat on the ground and grip a barbell with your hands slightly wider than your shoulders. Lower the bar down to your chest, then push it back up with control.</p><p>Bench presses are a great way to build a strong, broad chest and improve your upper-body strength. They can also be done with dumbbells or a machine, depending on your preference. However, they can be tough on your shoulders and wrists if done incorrectly, so it's important to use proper form and start with a light weight.</p><h3 id="pull-ups">Pull-Ups</h3><p>Pull-ups are a classic exercise for building upper-body strength and muscle, particularly in the back and biceps. They're also a great way to improve your grip strength and overall body control. To do a pull-up, grip a bar with your palms facing away from you, and pull your body up until your chin is above the bar. Lower back down with control.</p><p>Pull-ups can be tough to do if you're new to exercise, but they're a great way to build a strong, toned back and improve your upper-body strength. They can also be modified with a resistance band or assisted machine if needed. However, they can be tough on your shoulders and wrists, so it's important to use proper form and start with a light weight.</p><h3 id="dips">Dips</h3><p>Dips are an effective exercise for building upper-body strength and muscle, particularly in the triceps and chest. They can be done with a dip machine, parallel bars, or even a sturdy chair or bench. To do a dip, grip the bars or handles with your hands and lower your body down until your arms are at a 90-degree angle. Push back up with control.</p><p>Dips are a great way to build a strong, defined chest and triceps, and can be modified with a resistance band or assisted machine if needed. However, they can be tough on your shoulders and wrists, so it's important to use proper form and start with a light weight.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide to Bodybuilding Exercises</h2><p>If you're new to bodybuilding exercises, it can be helpful to have a step-by-step guide to follow.
