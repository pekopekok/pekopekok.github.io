Choose a workout that is less intense and promotes relaxation, such as yoga or stretching. 3. Avoid high-intensity workouts that can interfere with your sleep. 4. Wind down after the workout by taking a warm bath or reading a book. Tips to Stay Motivated: - Make it a habit by scheduling your workouts at the same time every night. - Use fitness apps or trackers to monitor your progress. - Don\u0027t push yourself too hard, and listen to your body\u0027s signals.
