This is because your body has been without food and water for a long period of time, and your energy levels are low. Working out before Iftar will help you to re-energize and refuel your body, as well as provide a sense of accomplishment for completing a workout while fasting. </p><p> If you're unable to work out before Iftar, another good time to exercise is after Taraweeh prayers, which are special prayers held during Ramadan. This is usually around an hour after Iftar, and your body has had some time to digest the food you've eaten. However, be mindful of your energy levels and don't push yourself too hard. </p><h2 id="how-to">How to Stay Fit and Healthy During Fasting</h2><p> Fasting during Ramadan can be challenging, especially when it comes to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Here are some tips on how to stay fit and healthy during fasting: </p><h3>1. Stay Hydrated</h3><p> Drink plenty of water during non-fasting hours to stay hydrated. This will help to prevent dehydration and fatigue during your workout. </p><h3>2. Eat Nutritious Meals</h3><p> Focus on eating nutritious meals during non-fasting hours. This will provide your body with the energy it needs to complete your workout and keep you feeling full throughout the day. </p><h3>3. Pace Yourself</h3><p> Don't push yourself too hard during your workout. Take breaks when you need to and listen to your body. </p><h3>4. Choose Low-Impact Exercises</h3><p> Choose low-impact exercises such as walking, yoga, or swimming. These exercises are less strenuous on your body and are less likely to cause injury or fatigue. </p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide to Working Out in Ramadan</h2><p> Here's a step-by-step guide to working out in Ramadan: </p><h3>Step 1: Warm-Up</h3><p> Begin with a 5-10 minute warm-up, such as walking or stretching. This will help to prepare your body for exercise and prevent injury. </p><h3>Step 2: Cardiovascular Exercise</h3><p> Incorporate 20-30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise, such as jogging, cycling, or dancing. This will help to increase your heart rate and burn calories. </p><h3>Step 3: Strength Training</h3><p> Incorporate strength training exercises such as push-ups, squats, or lunges. These exercises will help to build muscle and increase your metabolism. </p><h3>Step 4: Cool-Down</h3><p> End your workout with a 5-10 minute cool-down, such as stretching or walking. This will help to reduce your heart rate and prevent injury. </p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Working Out in Ramadan</h2><p> Here are some tips for working out in Ramadan: </p><h3>1.
